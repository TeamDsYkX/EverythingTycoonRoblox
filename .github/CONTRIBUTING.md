Before you start, you should determine the aspects you wish to contribute.
### Resolve Issues
If you wish to work on issues, view the list of issues [here](https://github.com/TeamDsYkX/EverythingTycoonRoblox/issues) and identify an issue that you believe you can resolve.
### Work Towards a Milestone
